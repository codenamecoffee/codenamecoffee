## ¡Welcome to _Federico González Lage´s_ portfolio...!✍🏻💻☕

_Hi, nice to meet you 🫱🏻‍🫲🏻_

I’m a Software Engineering student from Uruguay and a Junior Full Stack Developer in training, passionate about how algorithms allow us to understand and model reality.

Although my career path began far from IT, I found in programming the discipline that combines logic, creativity, and perseverance — the three things I value most.

What fascinates me most about programming is how computers let us simulate and predict — the closer our models get to the real world, the deeper our understanding becomes. I see code not just as a tool, but as a language to analyze, improve, and simulate complex systems, whether it’s personal finance, data patterns, or even human behavior.

I’m deeply interested in data analysis and how feedback from software can help us make better, evidence-based decisions — including how to improve ourselves. Still, i have a personal homework pending about deeply diving into cybersecurity, both because of curiosity as same as probably an almost basic need.

## 🚀 Professional Summary

I graduated from **Jóvenes a Programar**, and recently completed the **School of Software Engineering program (Endava, 2025)**, where I worked hands-on with modern DevOps practices and cloud-native tools:

- 🐍 Developed RESTful APIs with Python, using Pytest for automated testing and TestRail for test case management.

- ☁️ Built and deployed applications with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform in Azure DevOps.

- 🗄️ Managed persistence with PostgreSQL and JSON-based storage.

- 🧠 Integrated Gemini AI models into APIs to generate dynamic, contextual responses.

- 🧩 Practiced Git workflows, branching strategies, and CI/CD pipelines.

- 💻 Worked extensively in Linux environments using shell scripting for development and deployment.

<br>

Currently, I’m dedicating all my focus to consolidating my skills in **C# / ASP.NET Core** and **Angular**, while completing the **IBM Full Stack Software Developer Specialization (Coursera)** and improving my **English proficiency** through **Voxy** online platform.

I’m actively seeking my **first professional opportunity in IT**, aiming to join a team where I can keep learning and contribute meaningfully from day one.

## 🧭 Beyond Code

When I’m not coding, I enjoy functional training, kickboxing, and keeping up with the latest in technology, cybersecurity, and video games.
I’m always curious about how data, code, and human behavior intersect — and how to turn that into something useful.
